            Growing up in Indiana, Zach spent most of his youth outdoors, and helping out his Dad fix the cars in the garage.  These lead him to join the Boyscouts of America, where he went through the ranks and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout.  
            This interest in scouting lead him to his first job working as a camp counselor at the local Boyscout camp each summer in his highschool and college years.

          <p>
            After graduating from Ball State University, Zach pursued his passion for adventure and knowledge by moving to mainland China.  Where he then worked as an English teacher, teaching English to Chinese students by day, and learned Mandarin at night.  
            Wanting to expand on his Mandarin language learning studies.  Zach then moved to Taipei, Taiwan and spent the next four years refining his professional teaching skills and becoming 'fluent' in daily spoken Mandarin.  
            It was here in Taiwan, being surrounded by a plethora of new technologies that he developed an interest in technology.

            Then with the onset of a global pandemic, Zach decided to make his dreams a reality and take charge of his career by beginning to learn how to code.   
            He enrolled as a student at Kenzie Academy, where he learned: Javascript, React and Python.  
            Despite being a 12 hour timezone difference between Taipei time and Eastern standard time; from October 2020 to October 2021 Zach worked as an English teacher by day, and studied software development by night.  
            Those 16 hour days were a true testiment of perseverance, but in the end all of his hard work and experience in life has now given Zachary Balaska the confidence to take on any challenge.
